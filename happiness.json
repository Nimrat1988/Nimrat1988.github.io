  "overview": {
    "what": "Analyzed global happiness data (2005–2023) to understand how life satisfaction varies by country and what factors are most strongly linked to happiness.",
    "why": "Organizations and governments want to improve well-being, but happiness is influenced by multiple economic and social factors — not just income.",
    "soWhat": "The results suggest that policies combining economic stability with stronger social systems are more likely to improve happiness outcomes."
  },
  "keyQuestions": [
    "How does happiness vary across countries and regions?",
    "Which factors are most strongly associated with higher happiness?",
