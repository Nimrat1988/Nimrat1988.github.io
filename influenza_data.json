    "problem": {
      "what": "A medical staffing agency needs to prepare for seasonal spikes in demand caused by influenza.",
      "why": "Without data-driven planning, agencies risk understaffing during peak months and in high-impact regions—leading to delayed care and increased healthcare strain.",
      "solution": "I analyzed national flu-death trends and population data to identify where and when staffing demand rises, and which patient groups are most at risk, then summarized results in a Tableau dashboard for stakeholders."
    },

    "objective": "Support staffing planning for influenza season by identifying peak periods, high-need states, and vulnerable populations.",

    "keyQuestions": [
      "Which states experience the highest demand for additional medical staff?",
      "Which population groups are most affected and at highest risk during flu season?",
      "When does flu season peak, and how long does the high-demand period typically last?"
    ],

        "description": "Population by geography, time, age, and gender"
      }
    ],

    "method": [
      "Cleaned and standardized both datasets (types, missing values, consistency checks).",
      "Performed hypothesis testing to evaluate the relationship between 65+ population and flu-related deaths by state.",
      "Built Tableau visuals (trends, forecasts, maps) and a stakeholder-ready storyboard."

        "subtitle": "Flu-related deaths by age group (2009–2017)",
        "image": "assets/influenza_1.png",
        "insight": "Flu deaths rise sharply with age, making 65+ the highest-risk group and the top priority for staffing and prevention planning."

        "subtitle": "Seasonal trend in flu deaths across years (2009–2017)",
        "image": "assets/influenza_2.png",
        "insight": "Flu impact is strongly seasonal, with the highest demand in winter—especially from December to February—supporting early staffing ramp-up before the peak."
      },
      {
        "title": "Where High-Risk Flu Impact Is Concentrated",
        "subtitle": "State-level flu deaths with emphasis on the 65+ population (2009–2017)",
        "image": "assets/influenza_3.png",
        "insight": "High flu-death states overlap with large senior populations, indicating where staffing support is most critical—especially in high-need states like California and New York."
      } 
    ],

    "keyInsights": [
      "Adults aged 65+ face the highest risk of severe illness and death during flu season.",
      "California and New York show the highest influenza deaths, indicating higher staffing needs.",
      "Flu activity peaks in winter, especially from December to February.",
      "High-need regions often overlap with large older populations and historically high flu impact."
    ],

    "recommendations": [
      "Prioritize staffing and prevention programs focused on adults aged 65+.",
      "Increase temporary staffing in consistently high-need states such as California and New York.",
      "Begin staffing and resource planning early using historical trends to prepare for the December–February peak."
