    "problem": {
      "what": "Instacart has millions of orders, but raw data alone doesn’t explain customer behavior or where marketing efforts should focus.",
      "why": "The goal was to turn large-scale order data into clear insights that could support smarter promotions, customer targeting, and operational planning.",
      "solution": "I explored shopping patterns, spending behavior, demographics, and regional differences, then summarized the findings into actionable insights supported by visualizations."

      "Who are Instacart's most valuable customers?",
      "How does customer income vary across U.S. regions, and how can this inform marketing strategy?"
    ],

    "keyInsights": [
      "Sundays and Mondays are the busiest days, with peak activity between 9am and 5pm.",
      "Spending is highest around midday, which is a strong window for premium promotions.",
      "Middle-aged customers (45–70) are the most valuable segment based on order frequency.",
      "Older customers generally show higher income levels than younger adults.",
      "Regional differences suggest marketing and product strategies should be localized."
